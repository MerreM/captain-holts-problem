# captain-holts-problem

    Becuase holts' problem was annoying me, 
    here's a python implementation of it.

    You have tweleve people on an island.
    All weigh exactly the same apart from one of them, who 
    is slightly heavier or lighter than ther others.

    Using a see-saw and three comparisions (< or >) find out which.
